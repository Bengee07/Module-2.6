### Lesson Overview

By creating policies and tying them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources, you can manage access in AWS. In AWS, a policy is an object that, when linked to an identity or resource, defines the permissions for those objects. When an IAM principal (user or role) submits a request, AWS assesses these rules. Whether a request is approved or rejected depends on the permissions in the policies. The majority of policies are kept in AWS as JSON files. Identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and session policies are the six categories of policies that AWS supports.

Regardless of the technique you employ to carry out the operation, IAM policies define permissions for an action.
